# Implementation Plan for Bitfinex Lending Automation System

## Constitution Check
- [x] Security & Risk Management: API credentials properly secured, rate limiting implemented
- [x] Code Quality: Testing coverage meets requirements, type hints used, linting passes
- [x] Automation Safety: Confirmation requirements implemented, order validation in place
- [x] Reliability: Error handling and retry logic included
- [x] Market Awareness: Real-time analysis integrated into strategy
- [x] Compliance: License and disclaimers properly included

## Project Overview
Bitfinex Lending Automation System - Intelligent cryptocurrency lending bot with real-time market analysis, risk assessment, and automated order placement strategies.

## Objectives
- Implement Clean Architecture with domain-driven design
- Provide RESTful API for web/desktop UI integration
- Maintain performance requirements (<2s response, <100MB memory)
- Ensure security and compliance with constitutional principles
- Enable multi-user support with proper authentication

## Scope
### In Scope
- Backend API development with FastAPI
- Frontend development with React/TypeScript
- Database integration (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- Authentication and authorization system
- Real-time WebSocket data streaming

### Out of Scope
- Mobile app development (future phase)
- Advanced ML trading strategies (future phase)
- Integration with other exchanges (future phase)
- Hardware wallet support (future phase)

## Technical Approach
采用 Clean Architecture 模式，分層設計：
- Domain Layer: 核心業務邏輯和實體
- Application Layer: 使用案例和應用服務
- Infrastructure Layer: 外部依賴和資料存取
- Presentation Layer: API 和 UI 介面

## Timeline
- Phase 0: Research and Planning (1 week) - COMPLETED ✅
- Phase 1: Architecture Foundation (4 weeks) - COMPLETED ✅
- Phase 2: API Development (3 weeks) - PENDING
- Phase 3: UI Integration (4 weeks) - PENDING
- Phase 4: Deployment & Testing (2 weeks) - PENDING

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Rate limiting and validation

### Phase 3: UI Integration (4 weeks) - PENDING
- [ ] React + TypeScript frontend setup
- [ ] Authentication and user management UI
- [ ] Market data dashboard components
- [ ] Lending order management interface
- [ ] Portfolio visualization and controls

### Phase 4: Deployment & Production (2 weeks) - PENDING
- [ ] Production Docker configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Security hardening and compliance
- [ ] Performance testing and monitoring
- [ ] Production deployment and validation

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Complexity**: High - Clean Architecture migration requires significant refactoring
- **Performance Requirements**: Medium - Must maintain <2s response time during architecture changes
- **Security Compliance**: High - Multi-user system requires robust authentication
- **UI/UX Learning Curve**: Medium - React/TypeScript adoption for team

## Success Criteria
- Clean Architecture implementation with proper separation of concerns
- RESTful API providing all CLI functionality
- Web UI matching or exceeding CLI capabilities
- Performance metrics maintained or improved
- Security audit passing with zero critical vulnerabilities
